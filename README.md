## 🎶 Why MusicMate? 🎶

Because music is personal, but it's also social! It's surprisingly hard to share your music taste, especially if it's niche or completely different from your friends'. Whether you're into indie rock, old-school R&B, or hyperpop—people with unique music tastes often feel disconnected.

## ✨ Features ✨

### 🔄 Music-Match
A swiping game that helps users match with others based on musical compatibility. If you like someone, they're added to your friends list and you can instantly chat. If not, they're removed from your feed—simple and intuitive.

### 👤 Customizable Profiles
Share your top playlists, write a quick bio, and show off your vibe with our Y2K-inspired profile designs.

### 🎛️ Playlist Blender
Unlike Spotify Blend, we let you control how similar or how unique your blended playlist is, with a slider that puts you in charge of the mix.

### 🔍 Discover Music Tab
Stay in the loop with trending songs and top artists among your friends—without needing third-party tools.

## 🎮 PeachHacks Y2K Rewind Challenge 🎮

This project was created for the PeachHacks "Y2K Rewind: The 2000s Internet Revival" hackathon. We reimagined what a music social network would have looked like in the early 2000s—but with modern functionality.

## 👥 User Focus 👥

MusicMate is designed for:
- Spotify users seeking more social features
- Music lovers with niche tastes looking to connect
- Anyone wanting to discover new music through authentic social connections
- Users who miss the personality of early web design

## 💖 Our Vision 💖

We built MusicMate because we wanted to make music meaningful again—not just something you stream alone, but something that brings people together. Whether you're trying to find someone who vibes with your exact taste—or someone who might introduce you to something new—MusicMate makes that possible.
